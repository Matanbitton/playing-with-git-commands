# playing-with-git-commands

- learned about git amend and how it should never be used to amend commits that have been pushed to remote repositoires
- git rebase is very useful to edit commits but it is dangerous to use in a repository that others may work off of since it changes the history of commits
- git reset, used to reset local commits not commits that were pushed to a remote repo
- git push --force the danger of every newbie. should mostly not be used and better use --force-with-lease
